# liri-node-app



In this application you are able to type the following commands into the console to get results
       my-tweets - which will console log tweet history. 
       spotify-this-song will give you some information about the song in question.
       movie-this will give more information about the movie in question
       Do-what-it-says will use the node fs module and read a song from another file and then run the spotify method.

This app uses node.js to take arguments straight from the console. It uses the 2nd index for the method and the 3rd+ for whatever the user would like to search inside that method. 

Here is a link to gif of a couple commands that this app takes:
